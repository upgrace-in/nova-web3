          Our best scientists and creatives are working hard to maintain our connection with your universe, as it is of
          vital importance to us. Stay tuned for our experiments and bear witness to the birth of new advanced traits,
          new competitions, new friends, and new universes. Warning some of these could go terribly wrong, but we´ll
          take the heat, it won’t affect your reality (or will it…)
