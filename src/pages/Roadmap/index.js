            We have a need for uniqueness, to express ourselves, to be recognized and at the same time we want to be
            part of something bigger than us, we want to belong, to connect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through blockchain technologies we are merging our universe with yours. As we value uniqueness, community,
            competition, and entertainment above all else we want to create a bridge to experience real world sports,
            esports and gaming through the metaverse.

            We have downloaded our avatars to these things you call NFTs and want you to help us live the rush of
            euphoria that only humans experience.

            Make first contact with your kind to help the first 1000 NFANs with this transition so we can start the
            process of telepathic sensory translation or as you call it Minting. Once we are sprung into your reality,
            we can start having fun and compete. We crave euphoria, it gives us life. We will do it through a series of
            contests where the victors will come on top and have bragging rights (or what you call ETH). These
            competitions can be the simplest things or can scale up to massive worldwide events.

            Now that we have a strong foundation, we are working hard to build new ways to be in contact with our human
            ¨homies¨. We want to experience more euphoria, believe us when we say it’s good, and the best way for us to
            do this is with an App.

              scores) and bring the second wave of NFANs. With this technology we will have enough power to bring 3000
              more of our people to this reality. We will require more humans to bring them into this existence.
